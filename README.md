 #Purpose of the Movies_ETL: 
 ##The purpose of this challenge was to help Britta prepare a clean dataset into a SQL database for the hackathon.  It was to help participants to start with a clean dataset so they can start working on the project immediately.  To do so, we went through an ETL process(extract,transform and load) so it can be ready for the event.
 
#End Results of the ETL process:
